This script is for those who would like to perform analyses on their own textbook data (or any other data), to better understand the representation of minorities and women in text. These scripts should be very easy to use, so you *do not need any technical background* to run these analyses.

`git clone https://github.com/ddemszky/textbook-analysis.git`
